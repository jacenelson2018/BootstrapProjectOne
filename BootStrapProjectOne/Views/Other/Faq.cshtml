                                Something that I think will always be hard in either an internship or a full-time job (especially as a business student) is that there are so many great options.  It's a good idea to learn as much as you can about each company, make as many connections with people in those companies, and then to seek inspiration as you weigh the different options.  At the end of the day, you just have to choose!'

                                Many companies, especially the Big 4 Accounting firms, will often take their interns and offer them a full-time job at the end of it.  It is always a possibility that you won't end up liking the kind of work that you'll do with them; however, no matter what role, company, location, or focus you are currently working with, there is always something valuable you can learn that will contribute to something bigger and better that you DO love.
